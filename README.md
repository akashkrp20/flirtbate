This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

I have completed the task and shared it with you. The project is deployed on Vercel, and you can find the link below:
URL: https://flirtbate-six.vercel.app/

I have also uploaded the project to GitHub, and here is the link to the public folder:
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/akashkrp20/flirtbate

I used Next.js (version 15.2.3). To run the code, please follow these steps:

Pull the repository.
Run npm install.
Execute npm run dev.


```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
